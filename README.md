## Employee-payroll

System created for employee payroll

# Discprition

Created a payroll portal that allowed the business owner to enter info into a prompt to keep track of employee data.
I started by creating a function that prompted the user for info, and then pushed that info as key to make an obj in an array.
I then created a funtion to show the average salary and number of employees added
I finished up with a function to consolelog a random employee
I learned a lot about objects, arrays and building functions in js. It was challanging but rewarding when finshed

# Installation

The project was pushed to guthub. from there I went to the pages and launched the manin branch of my repo. This created a live environment
Here is the website URL to visit: https://mikededo58.github.io/Employee-payroll/

# Usage

start by selecting okay in the prompt. form their fill out all employee info until completed. when finshed hit cancel
